    This A Little Project that i was working on, it's not secure at all. so there're probably going to be more updates, like that the password is hashed, idk yet, just stay tuned :)

     
      THIS IS FROM MY GIST, FOR THESE STEPS YOU GOT TO GO TO MY GIST:https://gist.github.com/hogo1510/a771ca5020bce803bf9c99baaf0cd1ef
      OR JUST COPY THE CODE AND PUT IT IN YOUR SCRIPT LAB>
      
     It's made in Script Lab.
      if you want to use this then do this >
      you can copy the link of the gist, then go to excel, then go to Script Lab (If you don't Have Script Lab Them See This: https://appsource.microsoft.com/en-us/product/office/wa104380862)
      press on Import, and put the link of the gist there.
      then you need to press the run option (from the script lab tab)
      and the put the password: "Test!" in and the press "confirm" and then "Run"
      That's it
      
      you can't open it as a YAML File because you will need te run option of Script Lab, althoug i'm trying to fix it so you don't need script lab.
      but for now you will need Script Lab.
      If you found a way that you don't need Script Lab, then please let me know.
